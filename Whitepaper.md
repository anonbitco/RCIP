## Abstract
>News and reviews impact almost everyone in making day-to-day choices. Our lifestyle and consuming habits are derived from information we collect as we grow up. Besides family, friends, school and workplace, one of the most influential source is "News Media".  News and Reviews affect our perception, our choice of clothes, our food, our movies, our career and more. Because of ease access to internet in these days, news media can easily reach out massive population and manipulate the information. This makes our lifestyle and consuming habits depend on trust of news and media companies. Plus, we all know about paid promotion, paid news and fake reviews. Hence the system is broken and unfair. To solve this, we are proposing a decentralized and trustless news portal system where all news contents are reviewed and validated in decentralized fashion. Writers and validators are rewarded with Review Capital Token (RECAP) based on their quality of task. No more advertised news & no more paid news.

## Introduction

## Decentralized News Portal System

## Tokenomics of RECAP
Review Capital will operate in RECAP token with max supply of 11 millions RECAP tokens. RECAP is a ZRC-2 compliant fungible token which will primarily act as a reward incentives to news writers, validators and protocol developers. It costs 10 RECAP token to submit an article and 100 RECAP tokens to submit an advertisement. Every week, 33k RECAP tokens are minted for rewards until the supply of 11 millions RECAP lasts. These newly minted RECAP tokens are distributed on weekly basis. News writers get reward based on Trust Score of news & validators get reward based on their Profile Score.

Tokens are distributed in the ratio of 2:2:1 among Writers, Validators and Developers. If there exists no writers or validators in any week, the unpaid token goes to developers' wallet.


| Phases   | Involved Parties                          | Token Supply (RECAP)    | Percentage Own |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | :-----------:  |
| Minting  | News Writers                              | 13,200 Weekly           |      40%       |
| Minting  | Validators                                | 13,200 Weekly           |      40%       |
| Minting  | Team Development                          |  6,600 Weekly           |      20%       |
|          | Max Supply                                | 11,000,000              |     100%       |

When the max supply hits 11,000,000 RECAP tokens, network will run only on "News" submission fee and "Advertisement" submission fee.

## Why Zilliqa?

## Community Ecosystem
* News Writers: Anyone who submits news or article or review contents for publication is called News Writer. Each news writer gets reward based on Trust Score of news article.
>Trust Score: Trust score is a percentage value assigned to each article after curation from Validators. A news article with less than 50% Trust Score does not qualify for rewards. Validation are randomly push over to sample population of active validators for Publication Check, Evidence Check, Quality Check and Impact Check.

* Validators: Anyone who participates in validation of news content and advertisements is called Validator. Each validator gets reward based on Profile Score.
>Profile Score: Profile score is a percentage value assigned to each validator after completion of validation task. A validator with less than 50% Profile Score does not qualify for rewards. 

* Developers: Anyone who is a member of core team working on RECAP protocol is called Developer. Reward received in developer wallet is used for growth of RECAP ecosystem.


## Reward Mechanism
Since RECAP tokens are rewards to 3 parties: News Writers, Validators and Protocol Developers, there exists a distribution mechanism for fairness.

<i><b>Rewards of writers based on trust score of news articles</i></b>
All submitted news articles are validated and assigned a final Trust Score within 7 days. Trust Score for any news article is a percentage score ranging from 0 to 100. News article with less than 50% Trust Score does not qualify for rewards. To be eligible for rewards, following 2 conditions must met:
a) It must have Trust Score of 50% or more.
b) It must have passed 7 days period of publication before Weekly Reward Distribution is triggered.

Weekly reward pool = 40% of (minted + fee collected) = 13,200 RECAP + 40% of Collected fee

| Trust Score  | Weekly Rewards Pool %  | Weekly Rewards Pool (RECAP)   | Distribution  |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | :-----------: |
| 50% - 60%    | 5%                     | 660  RECAP  +  fee            |  Equal        |
| 61% - 70%    | 10%                    | 1320 RECAP  +  fee            |  Equal        |
| 71% - 80%    | 20%                    | 2640 RECAP  +  fee            |  Equal        |
| 81% - 90%    | 25%                    | 3300 RECAP  +  fee            |  Equal        |
| 91% - 100%   | 40%                    | 5280 RECAP  +  fee            |  Equal        |

If there is no articles in any of the group, the allocated rewards goes to Airdrop wallet to randomly reward "Writer of the Week" based on community vote.
