## Abstract
>News and reviews impact almost everyone in making day-to-day choices. Our lifestyle and consuming habits are derived from information we collect as we grow up. Besides family, friends, school and workplace, one of the most influential source is "News Media".  News and Reviews affect our perception, our choice of clothes, our food, our movies, our career and more. Because of ease access to internet in these days, news media can easily reach out massive population and manipulate the information. This makes our lifestyle and consuming habits depend on trust of news and media companies. Plus, we all know about paid promotion, paid news and fake reviews. Hence the system is broken and unfair. To solve this, we are proposing a decentralized and trustless news portal system where all news contents are reviewed and validated in decentralized fashion. Writers and validators are rewarded with Review Capital Token (RECAP) based on their quality of task. No more advertised news & no more paid news.
