# RIP
RECAP Improvement Proposals

People wishing to submit RIPs, can go to the [https://reviewcapital.org/submit-proposal] to submit their idea. We are open to all sorts of improvement proposals and community will discuss to vote for approval or denial of such changes.

Having a RIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.
